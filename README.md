# RetrieveBytes
Retrieve Bytes

A set of simple programs that returns a byte (8-bits) representation of a given positive integer. These programs do not handle truncating of bits properly. It can be modified to handle more bits, but for this example we are only considering 8 bits. Completed by Kevin in 2016.
